    # Peak versus off-peak rate windows for providers that bill by time of day.
    #
    # The windows are vendor-documented and fixed in UTC; none of the supported
    # provider APIs expose them at runtime (the Ollama usage endpoint returns
    # only fraction windows and the Z.ai quota endpoint only `limits[]`), so they
    # are declared here. Only the standing recurring schedules are encoded:
    # limited-time vendor promotions are intentionally not tracked, because a
    # hardcoded promotion would keep reporting a discount after it expires. When
    # a provider changes a schedule this table must be updated; see
    # docs/providers.md.
    #
    # Everything this module emits is timezone-absolute. Windows are anchored to
    # UTC calendar days, state is evaluated against UTC, and each schedule is
    # serialized as an alternating transition timeline of Unix epochs. A consumer
    # therefore resolves the current state and formats the current/next window in
    # its own local zone, with DST applied from the zone database, without
    # reimplementing the schedule and without knowing the machine's zone.
