# Status

CodexBar tracks two status layers for the three supported providers.

Provider health is still derived from quota fetch results:

- successful usage payloads render healthy, warning, or critical classes through the presenter
- provider fetch errors are preserved in snapshots and surfaced through UI/Waybar output
- stale snapshots are detected from `generatedAt` and `runtime.refreshSeconds`

External service status is cached in `status.json`:

- Codex uses OpenAI Status: `https://status.openai.com/api/v2/summary.json`
- Claude uses Claude Status: `https://status.claude.com/api/v2/summary.json`
- Gemini uses Google Cloud incident history: `https://status.cloud.google.com/incidents.json`

Use:

```bash
codexbar status
codexbar status --cached --format json --pretty
```

Waybar and QuickShell consume the cached status through `snapshot.json`; they do not poll status feeds directly.
